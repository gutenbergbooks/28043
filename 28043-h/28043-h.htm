<span class="i0">The iron twilight closes, and the steep<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Gates of the day where late the light was hurled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swing to on silent hinges, and a sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A still, white sleep is fallen on the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no stir these trackless miles around:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Earth is turned a grey cathedral close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is forgot all motion and all sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Beneath these smooth, obliterating snows.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One burning taper trembles ... and the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Curves like a dome where cloudy anthems are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above immaculate distances that lie<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In thoughtful adoration of a star ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth has her veil, and takes her silent vow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing save holiness is left her now.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">These blinking stars awake and tremble through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Re-blossomed from those gathering moods of time,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I have not known a quieter thing than ships,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor any dreamers steeped in dream as these,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For all that they have tracked disastrous seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And winds that left their sails in flagging strips;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing disturbs them now, no stormy grips<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That once had hurt their sides, no crash or swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor can the fretful harbour quite dispel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This quiet that they learned on lonely trips.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They have no part in all the noisy noons;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They are become as dreams of ships that go<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Back to the secret waters that they know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each as she will to unforgot lagoons,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where nothing moves except the ghostly spars<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That mark the patient watches on the stars.<br /></span>
